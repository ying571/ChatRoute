pub const GROK_APPLY_PATCH_INPUT_DESCRIPTION: &str = "Raw Codex apply_patch text. Marker and file-operation lines are exact literals. Start with `*** Begin Patch`, end with `*** End Patch`, and never append a trailing ` ***` to either marker or to Add/Update/Delete/Move headers.";

const GROK_APPLY_PATCH_LITERAL_RULES: &str = "CRITICAL LITERAL-SYNTAX RULE FOR GROK:\n\
The leading `***` characters are part of the Codex patch language, not Markdown emphasis. Never make the lines symmetrical by appending another ` ***`.\n\n\
CORRECT (use these lines exactly):\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Add File: notes.md\n\
+hello\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
INCORRECT (never emit this form):\n\
*** Begin Patch ***\n\
*** Add File: notes.md ***\n\
+hello\n\
*** End Patch ***\n\n\
Before calling the tool, verify that the first line is exactly `*** Begin Patch`, the final non-whitespace line is exactly `*** End Patch`, and no file-operation header has a trailing ` ***`. If the tool reports an envelope or marker format error, correct that exact syntax and retry `apply_patch`; do not blame a non-ASCII or absolute path and do not switch to a shell write merely because the marker syntax was wrong.";

pub const APPLY_PATCH_DESCRIPTION: &str = "Apply file changes using a structured patch format. This is ideal for multi-file or multi-hunk edits where shell-based file writes would be brittle.\n\
The patch language is a stripped-down, file-oriented diff format designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. A patch must use this envelope:\n\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
[ one or more file sections ]\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
Within that envelope, each file operation starts with one of these headers:\n\n\
*** Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line.\n\
*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.\n\
*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place, optionally followed by *** Move to: <new path>.\n\n\
Update hunks start with @@ and contain lines prefixed with a space, -, or +.\n\
Use *** Move to: <new path> after an *** Update File header to rename or move a file.\n\
Use *** End of File after update lines when you need an EOF-only insertion.\n\
Prefer workspace-relative paths. Absolute paths are accepted by Codex, but use them only when the user explicitly asks to edit that exact absolute path and permissions allow it.\n\n\
Call this tool with JSON arguments matching {\"input\":\"<the entire patch body>\"}. The `input` value must contain only the patch body and its final non-whitespace line must be exactly `*** End Patch`.\n\n\
Important rules:\n\
- For *** Add File, every content line must start with +. Blank lines must be written as +.\n\
- Do not write raw file content after an Add File header.\n\
- For *** Update File, context lines start with one space, removed lines with -, and added lines with +.\n\
- If apply_patch returns a format error, fix the patch and retry apply_patch before using shell commands to write files.\n\n\
Few-shot examples:\n\n\
Add a markdown file:\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Add File: notes.md\n\
+# Notes\n\
+\n\
+- First item\n\
+- Second item\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
Update a file:\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Update File: src/example.txt\n\
@@\n\
 old line kept as context\n\
-old value\n\
+new value\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
Move and update a file:\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Update File: old/path.txt\n\
*** Move to: new/path.txt\n\
@@\n\
-old name\n\
+new name\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
Delete a file:\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Delete File: old.txt\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
Update multiple files in one patch:\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Update File: src/lib.rs\n\
@@\n\
-pub mod old;\n\
+pub mod new;\n\
*** Update File: README.md\n\
@@\n\
-Old heading\n\
+New heading\n\
*** End Patch\n\n\
Insert at end of file:\n\
*** Begin Patch\n\
*** Update File: notes.md\n\
@@\n\
 existing final line\n\
*** End of File\n\
+appended line\n\
*** End Patch";
