# Troubleshooting

## Check The Daemon

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/status
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "running": true,
  "feishuWs": {
    "connected": true
  }
}
```

If `feishuWs.connected` is false, check Feishu credentials, websocket subscription, and `GET /api/events`.

## Check Remote-Control

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/remote-control/status
```

Important fields:

- `connected`: official Codex app-server is connected to the remote-control backend.
- `initialized`: the JSON-RPC `initialize` / `initialized` handshake has completed.
- `currentThreadId`: active Codex thread observed from app-server notifications or responses.
- `lastError`: last remote-control websocket error, if any.

If `connected=false`, check the Codex App side:

1. Codex App config contains `chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3847/backend-api"`.
2. Codex App auth is local `chatgptAuthTokens`, not API-key-only auth.
3. The `chatroute daemon` process is running before remote control is enabled.
4. Remote control is enabled in Codex App.

## API Key Auth Error

If Codex prints:

```text
remote control requires ChatGPT authentication; API key auth is not supported
```

then Codex App never reached the remote-control websocket. The local backend cannot fix this after the fact.

Use a local ChatGPT-shaped auth record:

```json
{
  "auth_mode": "chatgptAuthTokens",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": null,
  "tokens": {
    "id_token": "<local ChatGPT-shaped JWT>",
    "access_token": "<local ChatGPT-shaped JWT>",
    "refresh_token": "",
    "account_id": "acct_chatroute_local"
  },
  "last_refresh": "2026-05-26T00:00:00Z"
}
```

The third-party model key does not satisfy this check. It belongs in the model provider config and is used later for model calls.

`chatgpt_base_url` does not redirect OAuth refresh requests. Codex defaults to
`https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token`; the existing local `/oauth/token` endpoint
only handles step-up authorization-code exchange. The current `chatgptAuthTokens`
mode uses externally managed tokens rather than managed ChatGPT OAuth refresh.
The previous local `chatgpt` mode can still attempt refresh on a 401 before migration.
Neither mode bypasses workspace routing or plugin authentication checks.
See [authentication notes](auth-notes.zh-CN.md) for these limitations.

## Feishu Does Not Receive Messages

Check:

1. Daemon status: Feishu websocket connected.
2. Remote-control status: `connected=true` and `initialized=true`.
3. Feishu allowlists: `allowedOpenIds` and `allowedChatIds`.
4. Group chat mention behavior: if `mentionOnly=true`, mention the bot in group chats.
5. Event log: `GET /api/events`.

## Feishu Messages Do Not Reach Codex

The bridge sends Feishu text to the active Codex thread. It needs:

- remote-control connected and initialized
- an active current thread, or permission to create one through `thread/start`
- the Feishu conversation bound to that thread

If there is no current thread, send a message from Feishu. The bridge will show a thread-selection card or create/bind through the official app-server API, depending on the current runtime state.

## Approval Cards

Expected behavior:

- Feishu shows only one current approval card per conversation.
- Later approvals stay queued.
- After selecting an option, the original card changes to `已审批`.
- The next queued approval card appears after the current one resolves.

If old approvals are still clickable:

- make sure the daemon was rebuilt and restarted
- check whether `card.action.trigger` events are arriving
- check whether Feishu message update API has permission

If clicking an old card says "please handle current approval first", the bridge is preventing out-of-order approval, which is expected.

To disable bridge mode:

```powershell
chatroute --config config.toml off
```

## Manual Protocol Debugging

Use matching app-server and TUI ports:

```powershell
chatroute --config config.toml daemon
codex -c 'chatgpt_base_url="http://127.0.0.1:3847/backend-api"' app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:3849 --remote-control
codex --remote ws://127.0.0.1:3849 -C D:\path\to\project
```

This is for protocol debugging. Codex App should normally connect directly through `chatgpt_base_url`.

## Plugin List Warnings

Warnings such as:

```text
plugin/list featured plugin fetch failed
```

come from official Codex trying to fetch plugin metadata. They are usually unrelated to the Feishu bridge.

## Windows PowerShell Shell Snapshot Warning

Warnings such as:

```text
Failed to create shell snapshot for powershell
```

come from Codex shell snapshot support and are not caused by `chatroute`.
