# Architecture

`chatroute` bridges three systems:

- Codex App / official Codex app-server remote-control protocol
- A local ChatGPT backend-shaped base URL
- IM channel adapters: Feishu websocket/message APIs, Telegram Bot API, and WeChat iLink APIs

The planned AI Gateway is documented separately in
[`ai-gateway-architecture.zh-CN.md`](ai-gateway-architecture.zh-CN.md). It is an
independent model API layer for Codex Responses requests and must not be mixed
with the existing remote-control backend.

It is not a Codex client replacement. It implements the remote-control backend that official Codex app-server connects to, then adapts those JSON-RPC messages to IM channels.

The design target is strict:

- Codex owns threads, turns, cwd, approvals, tools, and execution semantics.
- `chatroute` owns only bridge-local transport state.
- IM channels are remote interaction surfaces attached to selected Codex threads, not a second source of truth.

## Process Model

The primary path is Codex App direct connection:

```text
Codex App
  |
  | ~/.codex/config.toml:
  |   chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3847/backend-api"
  |
  | user enables remote control
  v
official Codex app-server
  |
  | GET /backend-api/wham/remote/control/server
  | outbound websocket
  v
chatroute daemon
  |
  | Feishu websocket listener
  | Feishu message/card APIs
  | Telegram long polling / Bot API
  | WeChat iLink long polling / sendmessage
  v
IM channel
```

The daemon runs separately:

```text
chatroute daemon
```

It owns:

- local backend API
- official remote-control backend endpoints
- local ChatGPT backend compatibility endpoints needed by the app
- IM channel listeners
- in-memory route/thread/approval/card state

## Remote-Control Backend

The backend exposes the official Codex remote-control paths under `bind`:

```text
POST /backend-api/wham/remote/control/server/enroll
GET  /backend-api/wham/remote/control/server
```

Official Codex app-server connects outbound to those endpoints when Codex App has:

```toml
chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3847/backend-api"
```

and remote control is enabled.

Protocol notes:

- Codex sends `ServerEnvelope` values: `server_message`, `server_message_chunk`, `ack`, `pong`.
- `chatroute` sends `ClientEnvelope` values: `client_message`, `client_message_chunk`, `ack`, `ping`.
- The first client message is JSON-RPC `initialize`; after the initialize response, `chatroute` sends `initialized`.
- Server envelopes are acknowledged by `seq_id`; chunk acknowledgements include `segment_id`.
- Large outbound client JSON-RPC messages are segmented with the same 100 KiB target used by official Codex.

## Local Auth Shape

Remote-control startup is gated by Codex auth, before the websocket reaches `chatroute`. API-key-only auth is rejected by official Codex app-server.

For this project, the local identity shape is `chatgptAuthTokens`:

```json
{
  "auth_mode": "chatgptAuthTokens",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": null,
  "tokens": {
    "id_token": "<local ChatGPT-shaped JWT>",
    "access_token": "<local ChatGPT-shaped JWT>",
    "refresh_token": "",
    "account_id": "acct_chatroute_local"
  },
  "last_refresh": "2026-05-26T00:00:00Z"
}
```

The JWT only needs the ChatGPT-shaped claims Codex reads locally, especially:

```json
{
  "email": "chatroute-local@example.local",
  "https://api.openai.com/auth": {
    "chatgpt_account_id": "acct_chatroute_local",
    "chatgpt_user_id": "user_chatroute_local",
    "user_id": "user_chatroute_local",
    "chatgpt_plan_type": "pro",
    "chatgpt_account_is_fedramp": false
  }
}
```

The third-party model key is separate. It belongs in the Codex model provider configuration and is used for model calls, not remote-control enrollment.

## IM Bridge

The bridge has platform-specific adapters under `src/im`. Feishu receives websocket events, Telegram and WeChat use long polling. Platform adapters convert inbound messages into a shared `InboundMessage` shape before the bridge touches Codex remote-control.

Feishu handles:

- `im.message.receive_v1`
- `card.action.trigger`

Normal text messages are mapped to Codex input items and sent to the selected Codex thread through `turn/start`. Feishu and Telegram attachments are downloaded locally and converted into `localImage` or text file-path references.

Outbound Codex events are rendered as Feishu messages/cards:

- thread selection cards
- assistant streaming output
- command/tool cards
- completion cards
- approval cards

Telegram and WeChat use text-first renderers and inline/text actions instead of Feishu CardKit. Telegram edits existing menu and approval messages in place, aggregates command execution steps and subagent activity into separate bounded progress messages per turn, and streams agent replies with Bot API message drafts before sending the final message.

The bridge only renders events for threads that are bound to an IM conversation.

`userMessage` handling is asymmetric by design:

- Codex-origin `userMessage` items may be rendered to IM for a bound thread.
- IM-origin turns are marked in bridge-local runtime state by `turnId`.
- When Codex later emits `item/completed` for that same `userMessage`, the bridge suppresses it instead of echoing the IM message back into the same chat.

The bridge keeps one route per Codex thread. Route keys are platform-prefixed:

```text
feishu:<accountId>:<chatId>
telegram:<accountId>:<chatId>
wechat:<accountId>:<userId>
```

## Thread Subscription Model

IM channels do not automatically subscribe to every Codex thread.

The bridge keeps a one-chat-to-one-thread binding and relies on official remote-control thread APIs:

- `thread/list` for historical thread discovery
- `thread/loaded/list` for currently loaded threads
- `thread/resume { excludeTurns: true }` to subscribe to future events of a chosen thread

This is an explicit subscription step, not hidden client logic. Without it, the remote-control backend does not receive future item/turn notifications for arbitrary old threads.

Behavior:

1. An IM user sends a message.
2. If that IM conversation is already bound to a live thread, the bridge calls `turn/start`.
3. If it is not bound, the bridge asks the user to create or resume a thread instead of guessing.
4. After the user selects a thread, `chatroute` calls `thread/resume { excludeTurns: true }`.
5. Future notifications for that thread are then eligible for IM rendering.

This keeps the implementation aligned with the official remote-control model instead of inventing a parallel thread store.

## Codex App Runtime

`chatroute` is intentionally scoped to Codex App remote-control. Codex App is launched normally by the user, reads `chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3847/backend-api"`, and opens the remote-control websocket back to the local daemon. The project does not install a CLI wrapper or start Codex processes on the user's behalf.

## Approval Handling

Codex app-server sends approval requests as JSON-RPC server requests over remote-control. The bridge stores them as pending approvals.

Important rules:

- Request ids are preserved.
- Platform actions answer the original JSON-RPC request id.
- Decision payloads are built from the Codex app-server protocol.
- If `availableDecisions` exists, the bridge uses it.
- Otherwise compatibility decisions mirror Codex TUI behavior.
- The bridge only displays one current approval per conversation.
- Additional approvals remain queued and are sent only after the current approval is resolved.

When an approval action is selected:

1. The bridge sends `{ "decision": ... }` as the response to the original Codex server request.
2. The platform message is updated when the platform supports update semantics.
3. The selected option is shown in the platform-specific format.
4. The next queued approval prompt is sent, if present.

## Local API

The daemon serves the local API on `bind`, default `127.0.0.1:3847`.
The desktop GUI is the maintained user interface; the previous web console is no longer shipped.

## State Boundaries

`chatroute` owns only bridge-local state:

- config path
- IM channel credentials
- IM conversation to Codex thread binding
- pending approvals
- platform card ids/message ids
- downloaded attachments

Codex-owned state stays in Codex:

- project cwd
- sandbox policy
- model
- approval policy
- thread data
- tool execution semantics
- MCP configuration
- model provider keys
